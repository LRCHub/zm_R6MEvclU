[01:47.42] Talking away
[01:48.92] I don't know what
[01:50.27] I'm to say
[01:51.36] I'll say it anyway
[01:52.24] Today is another day to find you
[01:53.06] Shying away
[01:53.71] I'll be coming for your love, okay?
[02:11.21] 
[01:54.46] Take on me
[01:55.28] Take me on
[01:55.96] I'll be gone
[01:57.15] In a day or two
[02:04.65] 
[01:57.83] So needless to say
[01:58.74] I'm odds and ends
[01:59.70] But I'll be
[02:00.48] Stumbling away
[02:01.94] Slowly learning that life is okay
[02:02.79] Say after me
[02:03.63] It's no better to be safe than sorry
[02:21.63] 
[02:04.38] Take on me
[02:05.01] Take me on
[02:05.66] I'll be gone
[02:06.25] In a day or two
[02:13.75] 
[02:06.76] Oh, things that you say
[02:06.92] Yeah, is it a life or
[02:07.15] Just to play
[02:43.13] My worries away
[02:43.72] You're all the things I've got to remember
[02:43.94] You're shying away
[02:44.10] I'll be coming for you anyway
[02:58.60] 
[02:44.30] Take on me
[02:44.51] Take me on
[02:44.62] I'll be gone
[02:44.83] In a day
[02:48.83] 
[02:45.09] Take on me
[02:45.28] Take me on
[02:45.47] I'll be gone
[02:45.65] In a day
[02:49.65] 
[02:45.80] Take on me
[02:47.23] Take me on
[03:31.44] Take on me
