[00:34.13] We're talking away
[00:36.92] I don't know what I'm to say
[00:39.54] I'll say it anyway
[00:42.68] Today is another day to find you
[00:58.68] 
[00:45.94] Shying away
[00:48.68] I'll be coming for your love, okay?
[01:06.18] 
[00:51.34] Take on me (take on me)
[00:56.94] Take me on (take on me)
[01:02.59] I'll be gone
[01:07.40] In a day or two
[01:14.90] 
[01:13.45] So needless to say
[01:16.64] I'm odds and ends
[01:18.51] But I'll be stumbling away
[01:22.53] Slowly learning that life is okay
[01:39.03] 
[01:25.46] Say after me
[01:28.25] It's no better to be safe than sorry
[01:46.25] 
[01:31.05] Take on me (take on me)
[01:36.80] Take me on (take on me)
[01:42.46] I'll be gone
[01:46.90] In a day or two
[01:54.40] 
[02:33.19] All the things that you say, yeah
[02:36.46] Is it life or just to play my worries away?
[02:41.78] You're all the things I've got to remember
[03:02.78] 
[02:44.97] You're shying away
[02:47.92] I'll be coming for you anyway
[03:02.42] 
[02:50.62] Take on me (take on me)
[02:56.17] Take me on (take on me)
[03:01.86] I'll be gone in a day
[03:07.84] Take on me (take on me)
[03:13.26] Take me on (take on me)
[03:24.76] 
[03:18.91] I'll be gone (take on me, take on me)
[03:24.06] In a day (take me on, take on me)
[03:40.56] 
[03:30.38] Take on me (take on me)
[03:36.06] Take me on (take on me)
