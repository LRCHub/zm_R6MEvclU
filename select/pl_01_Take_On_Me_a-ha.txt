Talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today is another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be comin' for your
love again
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
At odds then ends but I'll be
Stumbling away
Slowly learning that
life is okay
Say after me
It's better to be
safe than sorry
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Oh the things that you say
Yeah isn't life oh just to play
My worries away
You're all the things
I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
(Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone in a day
(Take on me)
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
